# Fake-News-Classification
We propose and tune a XLM-RoBERTa Transformer and evaluate its performance in distinguishing fake news from real news in a multilingual context.

Due to size and licensing constraints, datasets are not included in this repository. They need to be downloaded and uploaded to the Jupyter notebook before running the code.
The datasets can be obtained directly from Kaggle:
