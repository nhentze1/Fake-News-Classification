# Fake-News-Classification

This repository contains code for **distinguishing fake news from real news** in a multilingual context using a **XLM-RoBERTa Transformer**. We tune the model and evaluate its performance on English, French, and Spanish datasets.

> **Note:** Due to size and licensing constraints, datasets are not included. You need to download them from Kaggle and upload them to the notebook before running the code.
